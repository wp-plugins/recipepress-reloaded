A simple recipe plugin. It does all you need for your food blog: add recipes as easily as extra post type or include them in your blog posts. Plus: there these nifty recipe previews in Google's search - automagically. Yet to come: easily create indexes of any taxonomy like ingredient, category, course, cuisine, ...

== Description ==

It basically adds a post type for recipes to your site. You can publish recipes as standalone posts or include in your normal posts and pages. 
Organize your recipes in categories, cuisines, courses, seasons, ... It'S up to your choice how many taxonomies you are creating. Of course there are post images and all the normal wordpress post goodies for your recipes as well.
